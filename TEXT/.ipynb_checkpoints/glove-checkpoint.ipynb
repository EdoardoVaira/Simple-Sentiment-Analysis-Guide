    "GloVe, or Global Vectors, is an algorithm that like Word2Vec is creating contextual embeddings. The difference is that while Word2Vec only considers local information according to the surroundings of a specific word, GloVe captures both local and global statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "It relies in the word-word co-occurrence probabilities with a set window-size in our dataset. The algorithm starts by creating a word co-occurence matrix from a large corpus. Firstly, it identifies the vocabulary of the corpus. Then for each word in the vocabulary, for a set context window size, count how often each word within this window around our given word appears throughout our corpus. Finally, the co-occurence matrix is created with each element representing the number the two corresponding words appear together. \n",
    "\n",
    "This word co-occurence matrix is used to examine the ratio of co-occurence probabilities between words. Moreover, this ratio between two target words given a context word can give insights on how close these two words are and is approxximated by the exponential of the dot product of the word vector of the given word and the two word vector of the target words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Word2Vec, GloVe does not train a neural network. Instead, it tries to minimize a least squares cost function that uses word vectors w_i and w_j between two words, such that their dot product plus bias terms approximates the logarithm of their corresponding co-occurence from the matrix.\n",

Both embeddings come in 50,100,200 vector sizes. We will use the 100d embeddings to redude dimensionality.

    "- **Scalability**: Works well with large datasets and can be easily scaled.\n",

    "- **Needs big dataset** : Requires a large amount of training data to produce high-quality embeddings.\n",
    "- **Out-Of-Vocabulary Issue**: Once again we work on a finite vocabulary, based on the corpus our model was trained on. If we have a new sequence with new words, they will not be taken into consideration when the embedding is produced, possibly losing important information.\n",
    "- **Polysemy issue**: Can struggle with words with multiple meanings since it produces one vector per word."

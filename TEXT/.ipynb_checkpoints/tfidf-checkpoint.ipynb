    "TF-IDF builds on the Bag of Words (BoW) approach to help us better understand and analyze text. Both TF-IDF and BoW represent text data as numerical values, but they differ in how they handle word importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bag of Words (BoW) method just counts how often each word appears in a document, treating all words equally. This can be a problem because common words like \"and\" or \"the\" might dominate the results, even though they don't carry much meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF gets around this by not only counting word frequency (like BoW) but also considering how common or rare a word is across all documents. It makes common words less important and increases the significance of unique or rare words. This makes TF-IDF a more refined method, helping to highlight the words that truly matter in understanding the content of a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, while BoW gives you a basic count of words, TF-IDF goes a step further by weighting these counts based on word significance, providing a more accurate reflection of the document's key topics."

    "### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Measuring relevance**: TF-IDF is great for figuring out which words are most relevant in a document. This can be really important for search engines and other text analysis apps.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Filtering Out Noise**: By reducing the impact of common words across documents, TF-IDF can filter out the usual \"noise\" or common words, allowing more relevant and unique content to stand out.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Simplicity and Efficiency**: TF-IDF is simple to understand and implement. It's also efficient, even with large datasets, because it requires minimal computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lack of Context Understanding**: TF-IDF doesn't take context into account, which can be a drawback for tasks that require understanding the meaning of the text.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Not Suitable for Short Texts**: In documents with very few words (like tweets or SMS messages), the TF-IDF scores might not be very informative since the frequency of words is generally low.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **High-Dimensional Output**: The vectors generated by TF-IDF are usually high-dimensional (one dimension per unique word in the corpus). This can result in sparse matrices, which are more challenging to manage and process for some machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Out-Of-Vocabulary Issue**: Again,the algorithm does not work with new sequences that contain words not included in the vocabulary used for fitting."

    "Word2Vec is a neural network-based model for learning word embeddings. Unlike in the frequency-based vectorization algorithms we have already seen (BoW and TF-IDF), the vector representation of words is said to be contextually aware. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Word2Vec, every word is represented as an n-dimensional vector. In the vector space, words having similar meanings exist in close proximity to one another, determined by the contecct in which they appar in the training corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very famous example of Word2Vec is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**king - man + woman = queen** \n",
    "\n",
    "From this we can see that Word2Vec can understand and solve analogies, by making operations in the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to train Word2Vec, CBoW and Skip-Gram.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### CBoW\n",
    "\n",
    "In CBoW, or Continuous Bag of Words, a NN with a single hidden layer is trained. It takes as input context (vincinity) words and its goal is to predict the current word. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example if we have the sentence \"the small kid ate a banana\", if we have vincinity=2, an input to the model can be (small, kid, a, banana) and the target word will be \"ate\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In this algorithm we choose a vincinity number m and then for every word in our sequences, a new dataset is prepared taking the m neighboring (context) words as inputs and the current word as a target. All context words in the vocabulary are turned into one-hot-encodings. For example, if the vocabulary size is 10,000, the word \"cat\" might be represented as a vector of length 10,000 with a 1 in the position corresponding to \"cat\" and 0s elsewhere. The model sums or averages the embeddings of the context words to create a single input vector. Then a NN with a single layer is trained using the new dataset. The objective of the algorithm is to maximize the probability of the target word given the context words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, we will not use the actual NN anywhere, but we will use the input-to-hidden weight vector as a word embeddings matrix. The size of the embeddings is the size of the hidden layer and we can define it as a hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say in our case the vocabulary is of size 39783. If we choose a hidden layer of 300 size, then the word embeddings matrix will be of size 39783x300, since every word will be an one-hot vector of 1x39783 size. Then we multiply our word with the embedding matrix and we get a vector of 1x300 size, which is our final goal. Basically, since the one-hot encodings are just 1 in the row of the target word and 0 everywhere else, we can directly get the word embedding by selecting the corresponding row of the word embedding matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skip-Gram\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip-Gram is the exact mirrored process of CBoW, in the sense that instead of feeding the network context words and trying to predict the current word, we feed the network the current word and it tries to predict context (vincinity) words. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example if we have the sentence \"the small kid ate a banana\", if we have vincinity=2, an input to the model can be \"ate\" and the target will be (small, kid, a, banana).\n",
    "\n",
    "Again in this algorithm we choose a vincinity number m and then for every word in our sequences a dataset is prepared taking the m neighboring words as targets and the word as input. The input words are one-hot encoded the same way as in CBoW.Then a NN with a single layer is trained using the new dataset. The objective of the algorithm is to maximize the probability of context words given a target word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, in the end the NN is not used, but the input-to-hidden weight vector as a word embeddings matrix. The size of the embeddings is the size of the hidden layer and we can define it as a hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the vectorizing of our dataset is done the same way as in CBoW.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CBoW vs Skip-Gram\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip-Gram is better when the dataset is small and emphasis on rare words is given. CBoW is better when the dataset is bigger, can better represent frequent words and it is faster to train.\n"

    "## Pros and Cons of Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive:\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Works well with large datasets and can be easily scaled.\n",
    "- **Low Dimensionality**: The dimensionality is exceptionally reduced, compared to the frequency-based methods.\n",
    "- **Context taken into account**: Semantics and context are the base element of the vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative:\n",
    "- **Needs big dataset** : Requires a large amount of training data to produce high-quality embeddings.\n",
    "- **Out-Of-Vocabulary Issue**: Once again we work on a finite vocabulary, based on the corpus our model was trained on. If we have a new sequence with new words, they will not be taken into consideration when the embedding is produced, possibly losing important information.\n",
    "- **Polysemy issue**: Can struggle with words with multiple meanings since it produces one vector per word.\n",
    "- **Fixed window space**: Context is limited to a certain window size around the target word, losing long range dependencies.\n"

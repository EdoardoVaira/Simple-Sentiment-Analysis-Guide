    "## Introduction to Bag of Words (BoW)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this educational notebook where we explore the Bag of Words (BoW) model, a foundational technique in natural language processing (NLP). BoW is particularly useful for converting text into numerical representations that can be fed into various machine learning models. This notebook will guide you through applying the BoW model to analyze customer reviews of the Netflix app.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Bag of Words?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bag of Words model is a way of extracting features from text for use in modeling, such as machine learning algorithms. It involves two primary steps:\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.\n",
    "2. **Vectorization**: Counting how many times each word (token) in the dataset occurs in each document and using this count as a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is BoW Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "BoW is crucial for many NLP tasks because it simplifies the complex task of understanding human language by reducing text to a bag of individual words. This model can be used for document classification, sentiment analysis, and other applications where text needs to be converted into a form that algorithms can process. Let's explore how we can implement and utilize this model effectively."

    "\n",
    "### Pros:\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: BoW is easy and fast to implement and interpret.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Easily adaptable for various NLP tasks.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Works well with large datasets and can be easily scaled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "- **Context Ignorance**: Fails to capture the context and semantics of words as order is not preserved.\n",
    "- **High Dimensionality**: Can lead to very high-dimensional feature spaces with sparse matrices, especially with large vocabularies.\n",
    "- **Common Words Issue**: Frequent words may dominate unless techniques like TF-IDF are used to normalize the counts.\n",
    "- **Out-Of-Vocabulary Issue**: It does not work with new sequences that contain words not included in the vocabulary used for fitting."

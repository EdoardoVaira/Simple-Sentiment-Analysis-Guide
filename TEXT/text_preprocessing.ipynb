    "\n",

    "   *Example:*  \n",
    "   `\"I'll be there\"` ‚Üí `\"i will be there\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Replace non-word characters with spaces to improve word separation.**  \n",
    "   *Example:*  \n",
    "   `\"Hello!!! How's it going?\"` ‚Üí `\"hello how s it going\"`\n",

    "   *Example:*  \n",
    "   `\"Soooo goooood!!!\"` ‚Üí `\"soo good\"`\n",
    "\n",

    "   *Example:*  \n",
    "   `\"This is is amazing\"` ‚Üí `\"this is amazing\"`\n",
    "\n",

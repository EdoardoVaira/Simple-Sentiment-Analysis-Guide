    "Word2Vec is a method for turning words into numbers (vectors) in a way that captures their meaning based on the context in which they appear. Unlike simpler methods like Bag-of-Words (BoW) or TF-IDF, which just count word occurrences, Word2Vec builds contextual word representations. This means that words with similar meanings end up with similar vectors in the Word2Vec model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A famous example of Word2Vec's power is the analogy:\n",
    "**king - man + woman = queen**\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that Word2Vec understands relationships between words so well that you can perform basic arithmetic on the vectors to solve analogies!\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Word2Vec Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec works by creating word embeddings, which are n-dimensional vectors representing words. So a single word will be represented as a list of n numbers. These vectors are trained using a neural network with two key architectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)\n",
    "- Skip-Gram\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the network is simple (just two layers) and the goal isn't to classify data but to learn the word embeddings from the training data. Once trained, you throw away the neural network and use the input-to-hidden weight matrix as your word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How CBOW Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In CBOW, the model takes words from the context (the words surrounding a target word) as input and tries to predict the target word.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** For the sentence:\n",
    "“I enjoy reading books about history,”\n",
    "if the context window size is 2, the model will take the words:\n",
    "[\"I\", \"enjoy\", \"books\", \"about\"]\n",
    "and try to predict the middle word, which is \"reading\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This is repeated for every word in the training data, using the neighboring words to predict the target word. You can set the context window size to decide how many words on each side of the target word to include.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the Neural Network is Built:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vocabulary and One-Hot Encoding:** First, every word in your vocabulary (all unique words in the text) is assigned a one-hot encoded vector. This is a large vector with a length equal to the vocabulary size, with a 1 in the position of the word and 0s everywhere else.\n",
    "    - Example: If the vocabulary size is 10,000, the word \"cat\" might be represented as [0, 0, 0, ..., 1, 0, 0] (vector of length 10,000).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Word Embeddings Matrix:** The input layer of the network is the one-hot encoded vectors for the context words. These vectors are multiplied by the input-to-hidden weights matrix, which gives you a much smaller vector called the word embedding (e.g., instead of a 10,000-length vector, you might get a 300-length vector).\n",
    "\n",
    "    After training, the weight matrix becomes your word embedding matrix, where each row corresponds to a word’s embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Objective:** The network learns by adjusting the weights to maximize the probability of correctly predicting the target word, given the context words. Once trained, you can discard the neural network and keep the learned embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding Matrix Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose you have a vocabulary of 39,783 words.\n",
    "- You define the hidden layer (embedding size) to be 300.\n",
    "- After training, you get a 39,783 x 300 matrix, where each word in your vocabulary is represented by a 300-dimensional vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you input a word (like \"cat\"), it is converted to a one-hot vector, which is then multiplied by the embedding matrix to get its word embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CBOW Summary:**\n",
    "- Input: Surrounding words (context).\n",
    "- Goal: Predict the middle word.\n",
    "- Training Output: A word embeddings matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skip-Gram\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip-Gram is the reverse of CBOW. Instead of using context words to predict a target word, Skip-Gram takes a target word and predicts the context words around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** For the sentence:\n",
    "“The small kid ate a banana”, with a context window size of 2, you would use the word \"ate\" as the input, and the targets would be the words [\"small\", \"kid\", \"a\", \"banana\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the Neural Network is Built:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is similar to CBOW, but in Skip-Gram:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The input to the neural network is a single target word.\n",
    "- The output is the prediction of the surrounding context words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the neural network is trained to maximize the probability of predicting the correct context words given the target word. Once trained, the word embeddings are stored in the input-to-hidden weight matrix, just like with CBOW.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skip-Gram Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: Target word.\n",
    "- Goal: Predict surrounding words.\n",
    "- Training Output: A word embeddings matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CBOW vs. Skip-Gram: Which One to Use?\n",
    "\n",
    "- CBOW is faster and works better on large datasets. It’s good at predicting common words and is often the default choice when you have a lot of data.\n",
    "- Skip-Gram is slower but better for smaller datasets and works well when you're focusing on rare words. It does a better job learning the embeddings for less frequent words.\n"

    "## Pros and Cons of Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive:\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Works well with large datasets and can be easily scaled.\n",
    "- **Low Dimensionality**: The dimensionality is exceptionally reduced, compared to the frequency-based methods.\n",
    "- **Context taken into account**: Semantics and context are the base element of the vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative:\n",
    "- **Needs big dataset** : Requires a large amount of training data to produce high-quality embeddings.\n",
    "- **Out-Of-Vocabulary Issue**: Once again we work on a finite vocabulary, based on the corpus our model was trained on. If we have a new sequence with new words, they will not be taken into consideration when the embedding is produced, possibly losing important information.\n",
    "- **Polysemy issue**: Can struggle with words with multiple meanings since it produces one vector per word.\n",
    "- **Fixed window space**: Context is limited to a certain window size around the target word, losing long range dependencies.\n"
